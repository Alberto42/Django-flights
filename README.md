# Django-flights

It's a simple django web application, that allows users to manage airline flights. 
It was written to pass "www applications" course. The code is in English, but the application language is Polish.

The following features are included:

  * Logging in and Signing up
  * Viewing, filtering and sorting flights
  * Adding and removing passengers
  * Displaying details of specified flight
  * Assigning crews to flights
  * Synchronizing of locally modified data, because one part of the application works offline
  * Script that genrates some random flights, planes, passengers etc.
  
The following(not obvious :D) technologies were used in the project:
  * RESTful web services
  * Typescript
  * Selenium Web automated tests
  * SQLite
